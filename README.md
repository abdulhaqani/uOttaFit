Health and fitness app while lounging on android
To start input a time and press Start
This will cause exercise reminder notifications to pop up on the android device periodically
for convenient testing purposes the duration between notifications was set to be approximately 10 seconds.
it should be noted that the code for setting the intervals between notifications requires only a single edit to make it follow the interval timer.
the interval timer is on settings, 20, 25 and 30 minute intervals are selectable.
the exercises are modifyable, all that needs to be done is that the check marks need to be unchecked if the user does not like that exercise.
exercise notifications are randommly selected from the checked exercises.
intensity of workouts are also modifyable, this is done by going to settings, then selecting an intensity.
changing the intensity changes the number of reps that the app notification tells the individual to do.



Enjoy! :)
